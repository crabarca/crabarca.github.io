## Hi, I'm Cristóbal

I'm just another software engineer that wants to share the cool stuff I'm currently working on.

When I'm not glued to a screen, you can find me outside climbing some [rocks](https://atakamaoutdoor.cl/blogs/lugares-de-chile/multilargo-los-miserables)

This site is the execution of a simple idea that has been in the back of my mind for years:

> have my own and somewhat independent space on the internet

Here you are most likely to find yourself with a direct stream of thoughts and ideas that pop-up in my head during my day to day work or simply
because of silly experimentation. Have fun!
