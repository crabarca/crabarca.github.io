## Hi, I'm Cristobal

I'm just another software engineer that want's to share the cool stuff I'm currently working on.

When I'm not here, I'm usually outside climbing some [walls](https://atakamaoutdoor.cl/blogs/lugares-de-chile/multilargo-los-miserables)

This site is the execution of a simple idea that has been in the back of my mind for years: 

```
have my *own independent* space on the internet
```

Here you are most likely to find yourself with a direct stream of thoughts and ideas that pop-up in my head during my day to day work or simply
because of silly experimentation. Have fun!
