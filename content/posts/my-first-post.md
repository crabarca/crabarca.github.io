## Things I learned while creating this blog

### CommonMark: The high compatible specification of Markdown

I always suspected about the flavors of markdown, but never took the time to dig deeper on what are the differents types of "markdown" style syntax available. To my surprise, CommonMark is already adopted in the following:

- Discourse
- GitHub
- GitLab
- Reddit
- Qt
- Stack Overflow / Stack Exchange
- Swift
